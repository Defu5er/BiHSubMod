# TFR Peace That Cannot Last
 A The Fire Rises Submod, giving content for the nation of Bosnia

Short descrption:
Ever since the war for its independence in the 1990's, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been in what can be described as a never-ending state of turmoil. Threats of secession and violence are ever growing, the economy is becoming stagnant, its already complex political institutions withering away with corruption taking root, the young and able are fleeing for they see no future in an empty husk, these are the problems the inhabitants of these lands go through daily, almost unaffected. Yet, the question remains as to when will it all crumble down and who will crash it all down, be it for their own good or for the greater good of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The year is 2020, 25 years after the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, yet it is almost as if the peace never came. The fuses have been lit and it's only a matter of time before everything comes down. The secessionists are getting bolder, political extremists growing bigger, the world ever changing. 

The lights have gone out, good luck!

Progress:
Almost zero.
